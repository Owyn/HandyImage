<h3>Features</h3>
<p>This script leaves just the image (largest available version) on pages of <strong>many image hosting sites</strong> skipping all the annoying stuff like ads, "continue to image" etc and <strong>disabling</strong> any kind of <strong>pop-ups</strong>. (script for images opened directly in browser can be found <a href=https://github.com/Owyn/Center_Image>here</a> - if you like centering of image, autoresize and hotkeys)</p>

<ul><li><strong>Hotkeys</strong> - very handy ones</li>
<li><strong>fullsizing</strong> image to its largest available version when opened, <strong>nothing else</strong> than image</li>
<li><strong>autofit</strong> to screen big images by default (larger than screen both vertically and horizontally)</li>
<li><strong>address</strong> of page doesn't change so you still can copy\share it</li>
<li><strong>image centering</strong> (like in firefox) - pretty usefull on wide monitors</li>
<li><strong>configurable</strong> - choose background color and what images to fit to screen when opened, or run your js</a></li>
<li><strong>fast</strong> - does its job before page loads its resources (or run JavaScripts in FireFox)</li>
<li><strong>fail-safe</strong> - if it didn't find image to fullsize - it won't do anything to mess the page up and will try again in few sec.</li></ul>

<h3>Hotkeys</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>WASD</strong> \ <strong>arrows</strong> \ <strong>num4862</strong> - scroll image to right\left\top\bottom accordingly</li>
<li><strong>Q</strong> \ <strong>num5</strong> \ <strong>click on image</strong> - resize image from full-window-size to original and vica versa</li>
<li><strong>Tab</strong> \ <strong>Enter</strong> \ <strong>Middle Mouse Click on image</strong> - resize image to fill the window with it or return it to original</li>
<li><strong>ctrl+space</strong> and <strong>ctrl+shift+space</strong> - simular to scroll of spacebar but horizontally</li>
<li><strong>P</strong> \ <strong>menu item</strong> in (tamper\grease)monkey icon - open configuration menu</li>
<li><strong>R</strong> - reload page with script disabled (to see comments etc)</li>
<li><strong>ctrl + S</strong> - save image (same as when you right click the image and press save as)(you have to press it twice in Chrome)</li>
</ul>

You need a userscript manager to install and use the script, e.g. <a href="https://violentmonkey.github.io/">ViolentMonkey</a> or <a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/">TamperMonkey</a>

<h3>How to request a new imagehost support or fix for old one</h3>
<p>Please, if you would like to request a new site or report a non-working one, please, remember to write at least ONE image URL where the script should work, then head right to <strong><a href="https://github.com/Owyn/HandyImage/issues">Feedback section</a></strong>.</p>

<p>In the topic title, write "fix" if the site is already on the list or "add" if it is a new request, and the domain (eg: add googleimagehost.com)</p>

<em>* But keep in mind that when requesting nameless non-popular image hosting google knows not much about you'd have to provide a reason for adding it - a website url which uses that hosting a lot for images</em>
<br><em>** Or if you are a developer yourself and would like to help add new hosts, you can <a href="https://github.com/Owyn/HandyImage/blob/master/Tutorial:%20adding%20new%20imagehosts%20support.md">submit code edits</a> at <a href="https://github.com/Owyn/HandyImage">GitHub page</a></em>

<h3>If the userscript runs on a page incorrectly:</h3>
<p>Try disabling your ADBlocker for that site - occasionally it might prevent not only ads but this script as well from working there
