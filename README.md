# HANDY JUST IMAGE

<h3>Features</h3>
This script opens fullsized image right after page load in <strong>many image hosting sites</strong> skipping all the annoying stuff like ads, link code etc and <strong>disabling</strong> any kind of <strong>pop-ups</strong>. (script for images opened directly in browser can be found <a href=https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/177505>here</a>)

<ul><li><strong>Hotkeys</strong> - very handy ones</li>
<li><strong>fullsizing</strong> image to its original size when opened, <strong>nothing else</strong> than image</li>
<li><strong>autofit</strong> to screen big images by default (larger than screen both vertically and horizontally)</li>
<li><strong>address</strong> of page doesn't change so you still can copy\share it</li>
<li><strong>image centering</strong> (like in firefox) - pretty usefull on wide monitors</li>
<li><strong>configurable</strong> - choose background color and what images to fit to screen when opened, or <a href="https://userscripts.org/topics/177503">run your js</a></li>
<li><strong>fast</strong> - does its job before page loads its resources (or run JavaScripts in FireFox)</li>
<li><strong>fail-safe</strong> - if it didn't find image to fullsize - it won't do anything to mess the page up and will try again in few sec.</li></ul>

<h3>Hotkeys</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>WASD</strong> \ <strong>arrows</strong> \ <strong>num4862</strong> - scroll image to right\left\top\bottom accordingly</li>

<h3>How to request a new imagehost support or fix for old one</h3>
Please, if you would like to request a new site or report a non-working one, please, remember to write at least ONE image URL where the script should work, then head right to <strong><a href="https://userscripts.org/scripts/discuss/166494">Discussions section</a></strong>.

In the topic title, write "fix" if the site is already on the list or "add" if it is a new request, and the domain (eg: add googleimagehost.com)<br><br>

<em>* But keep in mind that when requesting nameless non-popular image hosting google knows not much about you'd have to provide a reason for adding it - a website url which uses that hosting a lot for images</em>
<br><br><em>** Or if you are a developer yourself and would like to help add new hosts, you can <a href="https://userscripts.org/topics/131342">submit code edits</a> at <a href="https://github.com/Owyn/HandyImage">GitHub page</a>
